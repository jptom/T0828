# Instance segmentation
## dataset
  Tiny pascal voc dataset
  - 1349 training images
  - 100 testing images
  - 20 classes

# trianing and testing
There is only one .ipynb including traing and testing.  
This program work on google colab, and I recommend to use gpu mode.  
Put the dataset like this.
```bash
.
├── working directory
    ├── dataset
        ├── test_image
        ├── train_image
        ├── test.json
        ├── train.json
```
